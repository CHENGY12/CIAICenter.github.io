## CIAI Center website

MBZUAI's CIAI <i>(Center for Integrative Artificial Intelligence)</i> has been created to further develop an AI operating system (OS) based on the foundation of the [CASL](https://lnkd.in/dBYJ7GX) project. The center is led by MBZUAI President [Eric Xing](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-xing) and center director [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/). This website is still under development.
