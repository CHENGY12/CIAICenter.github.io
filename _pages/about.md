Welcome to the **CIAI** Group! MBZUAI's CIAI <i>(Center for Integrative Artificial Intelligence)</i> has been created to further develop an AI operating system (OS) based on the foundation of the [CASL](https://lnkd.in/dBYJ7GX) project. The center is led by MBZUAI President [Eric Xing](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-xing) and center director [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/) and has brought together a team of highly experienced and senior systems and machine learning engineers, and researchers, who are passionate in building systems.The aim of the center is to develop the next generation OS that can support easy composition, experimentation, and deployment of even the most advanced ML-pipelines such as building GPT3-like language models for new tasks, or full-stack AI systems for clinical management.

<strong>Objectives</strong>

An integrative AI system is not a monolithic blackbox, but a modular, standardizable, and certifiable assembly of building blocks at all levels: data, model, algorithm, computing, and infrastructure, etc. At CIAI, we seek to develop principled approaches including representations, optimization formalisms, intra- and inter-level mapping strategies, theoretical analysis, and production platforms for optimal and potentially autonomous creation and configuration of AI solutions at ALL LEVELS â€“ data harmonization, model composition, learning to learn, scalable computing, and infrastructure orchestration. 

We believe ML at All Level is a necessity, not just a preference, toward industrializing AI that can be considered transparent, trustworthy, and cost effective.
