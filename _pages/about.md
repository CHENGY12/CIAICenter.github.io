Welcome to the **CIAI** Group! MBZUAI's CIAI <i>(Center for Integrative Artificial Intelligence)</i> has been created to further develop an AI operating system (OS) based on the foundation of the [CASL](https://lnkd.in/dBYJ7GX) project. The center is led by MBZUAI President [Eric Xing](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-xing) and center director [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/) and has brought together a team of highly experienced and senior systems and machine learning engineers, and researchers, who are passionate in building systems.The aim of the center is to develop the next generation OS that can support easy composition, experimentation, and deployment of even the most advanced ML-pipelines such as building GPT3-like language models for new tasks, or full-stack AI systems for clinical management.
